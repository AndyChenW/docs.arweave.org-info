# Wallet FAQ

## **Which wallet\(s\) can I use for AR tokens?**

AR is currently only compatible with the Arweave web extension wallet. You can download it  from [**Chrome**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/arweave/iplppiggblloelhoglpmkmbinggcaaoc), [**Firefox**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/arweave/), or [**Brave**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/arweave/iplppiggblloelhoglpmkmbinggcaaoc).

## **How do I use the Arweave web extension wallet?**

Lucky for you, we’ve created a step-by-step guide which can be [**found here**](https://docs.arweave.org/info/wallets/arweave-web-extension-wallet)**.**

## **Can I use the Arweave wallet as a cold wallet?**

Yes, you can find detailed instructions for how to securely generate an Arweave cold wallet with the official Arweave web extension [here](https://docs.arweave.org/info/wallets/generating-cold-wallet). 

**\* Please make sure to keep multiple copies of your wallet keyfile in secure locations, as we cannot help you to recover your wallet if you lose it \***

## **Are AR tokens compatible with any hardware wallets?**

At the moment, unfortunately not. We would like to achieve this in the future, but for now we are prioritising other deliverables for the community. 

## **Can I send AR tokens to MyEtherWallet/another third party wallet or an ETH address?**

No, these are fundamentally incompatible. Don’t send your AR tokens to any wallets other than the Arweave web extension wallet!
