# Mining Guide

{% hint style="warning" %}
**For any questions and support queries regarding mining on Arweave, we strongly recommend that you join our** [**Discord server**](https://discord.gg/DjAFMJc) **as this is the hub of our mining and developer communities. Here you will find plenty of community members and Arweave team members available to help you out** ðŸ¤– 
{% endhint %}

## Preparation: Linux 

1. **Install an up-to-date version of** [**Erlang**](https://www.erlang.org/downloads) **\(Erlang/OTP 21\), git, libsqlite3-dev or equivalent, and libssl-dev or equivalent**

   \(usually available from your Linux distributionâ€™s package manager\)

2. **Use git to clone the latest stable release using the following command:**

```
git clone https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave.git arweave && \
cd arweave && git -c advice.detachedHead=false checkout stable
```

Alternatively, you can simply run this [script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/master/install.sh) on a fresh Ubuntu installation. Because this script installs dependencies for you it will require your root password, so please make sure you are comfortable with the commands that it will run before execution. You can download and execute the script with this command:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/stable/install.sh | bash
```

## Preparation: Other Operating Systems

In order to run the Arweave miner on Mac OS X please execute the following steps:

1. **Install** [**Homebrew**](https://brew.sh/)\*\*\*\*
2. **Install Erlang OTP 21: `brew install erlang@21 brew link --force erlang@21`**  If you are already using Erlang OTP 20, switch to the new version: **`brew unlink erlang@20 brew link --force erlang@21`**
3. **Finally, run the following command:** 

```text
git clone https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave.git arweave && \
cd arweave && git -c advice.detachedHead=false checkout stable
```

{% hint style="info" %}
It is also possible to set-up an Arweave mining environment on Windows using the â€˜Windows Subsystem for Linuxâ€™ or a virtual machine environment
{% endhint %}

## Preparation: File Descriptors Limit

The number of available file descriptors affects the rate at which your node can process data. The default limit assigned to user processes in the operating systems is usually low, so we recommend to increase it.

You can check the current limit by executing `ulimit -n`.

On Linux, to set a bigger limit, open `/etc/security/limits.conf` and edit \(or add\) the line:

```text
<your OS user>         soft    nofile  10000
```

Open a new terminal session \(you can also change the limit for the current session via `ulimit -n 10000`\). Make sure the limit is increased - `ulimit -n`.

## Running the Miner

Now youâ€™re ready to start the mining process by using the following command from the Arweave directory: 

```text
./arweave-server mine mining_addr YOUR-MINING-ADDRESS peer 188.166.200.45 peer 188.166.192.169 peer 159.203.158.108 peer 139.59.51.59 peer 138.197.232.192
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please replace **YOUR-MINING-ADDRESS** with the address of the wallet you would like to credit when you find a block!
{% endhint %}

If you would like to see a log of your minerâ€™s activity, you can run **â€˜make logâ€™** in the Arweave directory in a different terminal. The miner terminal itself only displays the most important logs to keep it clean so that you can interact with the system using the console.

## Tuning the Miner

To get an additional performance boost, consider configuring huge memory pages in your OS.  
  
On Ubuntu, to see the current values, execute:`cat /proc/meminfo | grep HugePages`. To set a value, run `sudo sysctl -w vm.nr_hugepages=2000`. "2000" corresponds to two thousand pages 2 MiB each. Do not set a value bigger than the amount of available memory \("free" in `top)` minus 6 GiB.

You can benchmark your machine's performance with different settings by running `./arweave-server benchmark randomx enable randomx_large_pages`. Note that you have to stop the miner before running the benchmark.

It is recommended to reboot the machine after configuring huge pages and before running the miner, especially if the machine had a significant uptime before to the change. To make the configuration survive reboots, create `/etc/sysctl.d/local.conf` and put `vm.nr_hugepages=[YOUR NUMBER]` there.

## Troubleshooting

### Make sure your node is accessible on the Internet

An important part of the mining process is discovering blocks mined by other miners. Your node needs to be accessible from anywhere on the Internet so that your peers can connect with you and share their blocks.

To check if your node is publicly accessible, browse to `http://[Your Internet IP]:1984`. If you specified a different port when starting the miner, replace "1984" anywhere in these instructions with your port. If you can not access the node, you need to set up TCP port forwarding for incoming HTTP requests to your Internet IP address on port 1984 to port 1984 on your mining machine. For more details on how to set up port forwarding, consult your ISP or cloud provider.

Missing port forwarding is a common reason for the warning which begins with:  
  
`"WARNING: No foreign blocks received from the network.`

Alternatively, you can run the miner in the polling mode. In this mode, your node does not have to be publicly accessible. It would check with other peers for updates at regular intervals. To run in the polling mode, specify "polling" in the command line:

```text
./arweave-server polling mine mining_addr YOUR-MINING-ADDRESS peer 188.166.200.45 peer 188.166.192.169 peer 159.203.158.108 peer 139.59.51.59 peer 138.197.232.192
```

Note that the polling mode is significantly less efficient.

### Wait until the blocks are downloaded

The Arweave miner does not mine without data. For every new block in order to mine it, a random block from the past is required. It takes a few days to download all the blocks from the peers so do not expect the mining to be very intensive after the first launch. For example, if you have 10% of the total amount of blocks, you have a 10% chance for being able to participate in mining the next block.

The following log indicates the miner does not have a block required to mine the current block \(the network mines a new block approximately every two minutes\). You do not have to take any action.

`=INFO REPORT==== 13-Mar-2019::11:02:20 === could_not_start_mining stored_recall_block_for_foreign_verification`

### Bootstrap the second miner faster

If you want to bootstrap another miner on a different machine, you can copy the downloaded data over from the first miner to bring it up to speed faster. Please follow these steps:

1. Stop the first Arweave miner \(also, do not run the new miner just yet\).
2. Copy the following folders to the new machine: `blocks`, `txs`, `wallet_lists`, `data`.
3. Start the miners.

### Run a miner on Windows

We do not recommend using Windows for mining because according to our experience it is less efficient and reliable. Nevertheless, mining on Windows is possible.

You can run an Arweave miner inside Windows Subsystem for Linux \(WSL\). Note that the default TCP configuration WSL relies on is more restrictive than a typical Linux configuration. The WSL configuration offers about half as many TCP ports for making TCP connections and twice as long socket re-use timeout, what significantly reduces the number of simultaneous requests per second the miner can make to other nodes.

As a result, you may see the following errors in the miner console:  
  
  
`=ERROR REPORT====...=== Socket connection error: exit badarg, [{gen_tcp,connect,4, [{file,"gen_tcp.erl"},{line,149}]}`

  
Windows Event Log is expected to have the following warning:  
  
`TCP/IP failed to establish an outgoing connection because the selected local endpoint was recently used to connect to the same remote endpoint. This error typically occurs when outgoing connections are opened and closed at a high rate, causing all available local ports to be used and forcing TCP/IP to reuse a local port for an outgoing connection. To minimize the risk of data corruption, the TCP/IP standard requires a minimum time period to elapse between successive connections from a given local endpoint to a given remote endpoint.`
