# Mining Guide



## Preparation: Linux 

1. **Install an up-to-date version of** [**Erlang**](https://www.erlang.org/downloads) **\(Erlang/OTP 20+\), git and libssl-dev or equivalent**

   \(usually available from your Linux distributionâ€™s package manager\)

2. **Use git to clone the latest stable release using the following command:**

```
git clone https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave.git arweave && \
cd arweave && git -c advice.detachedHead=false checkout stable
```

Alternatively, you can simply run this [script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/master/install.sh) on a fresh Ubuntu installation. Because this script installs dependencies for you it will require your root password, so please make sure you are comfortable with the commands that it will run before execution. You can download and execute the script with this command:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/stable/install.sh | bash
```

## Preparation: Other Operating Systems

In order to run the Arweave miner on Mac OS X please execute the following steps:

1. **Install** [**Homebrew**](https://brew.sh/)\*\*\*\*
2. **Run â€˜brew install erlang@20â€™**
3. **Finally, run the following command:** 

```text
git clone https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave.git arweave && \
cd arweave && git -c advice.detachedHead=false checkout stable
```

{% hint style="info" %}
It is also possible to set-up an Arweave mining environment on Windows using the â€˜Windows Subsystem for Linuxâ€™ or a virtual machine environment
{% endhint %}

## Running the Miner

Now youâ€™re ready to start the mining process by using the following command from the Arweave directory: 

```text
./arweave-server \
                peer 52.56.119.91 peer 34.216.88.202 \
                peer 54.93.54.173 peer 18.130.126.49 \
                peer 13.231.142.3 peer 18.179.119.203 \
                peer 54.159.24.25 peer 54.175.114.204 \
                mine mining_addr YOUR-MINING-ADDRESS
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please replace **YOUR-MINING-ADDRESS** with the address of the wallet you would like to credit when you find a block!
{% endhint %}

If you would like to see a log of your minerâ€™s activity, you can run **â€˜make logâ€™** in the Arweave directory in a different terminal. The miner terminal itself is left clear so that you can interact with the system using the console.
